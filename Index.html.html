<h2>WEB이란 무엇인가?</h2>
<p>WEB is a computer programming system created by Donald
  E. Knuth as the first implementation of what he called
   "literate programming": the idea that one could create
    software as works of literature, by embedding source
    code inside descriptive text, rather than the reverse
    (as is common practice in most programming languages),
     in an order that is convenient for exposition to human
     readers, rather than in the order demanded by the compiler.

<p style="margin-top:45px;">HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images
 and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page.
  HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics
  for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items.
  HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets.
  Tags such as directly introduce content into the page.</P>
